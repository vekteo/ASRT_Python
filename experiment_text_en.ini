mw_intro = Please try to focus on the task the entire time. However, it's natural for your thoughts to drift away from time to time.\n\nTo investigate this, we will interrupt the task a few times and ask you four questions about whether you were focused on the task or thinking about something else.\n\nUse the 1, 2, 3, and 4 keys to answer these questions!
mw_q1 = First, we will ask you to what extent you were focused on the task during the previous block.\n\nThe response options will be on a 4-point scale ranging from '1: Not focused on the task at all' to '4: Completely focused on the task'.\n\nThe answer '1: Not at all' means that your thoughts were completely elsewhere (e.g., you were thinking about friends, weekend plans, etc.).\n\nThe answer '4: Completely' means that you were totally focused on the task (on where the dog's head appeared and which key you should press as fast as possible).\n\nSelect 2 or 3 if you feel your answer falls between 1 and 4.
mw_q2_off_task = If you respond to the first question that you were somewhat distracted during the task, the second question will ask if, when you were not focused on the task, you were thinking of something specific or not thinking of anything at all.\n\nThe response options will be on a 4-point scale ranging from '1: I was thinking about nothing' to '4: I was thinking about something in particular'.\n\nThe answer '1: I was thinking about nothing' means your thoughts drifted, but you don't remember anything specific, as if your mind was completely blank.\n\nThe answer '4: I was thinking about something in particular' means you were thinking about something in particular (e.g., a book, recent events, the task is very easy, you are hungry, or that sitting during the task is uncomfortable).\n\nSelect 2 or 3 if you feel your answer falls between 1 and 4.
mw_q3_spontaneous = Next, the third question will ask whether your focus (whether on the task or elsewhere) was intentional or spontaneous.\n\nThe response options will be on a 4-point scale ranging from '1: I was completely spontaneous' to '4: I was completely deliberate'.\n\nThe answer '1: I was completely spontaneouss' means that your attention required no effort to direct. If you were focused on the task, it happened automatically and concentration was not difficult. If your thoughts drifted, it happened despite you wanting to focus on the task.\n\nThe answer '4: I was completely deliberate' means that you consciously directed your attention. If you were focused on the task, it was a deliberate decision and you made an effort to concentrate. If your thoughts drifted, it was because you consciously decided to think about something else (like the weekend), which can happen if the task bores you.\n\nSelect 2 or 3 if you feel your answer falls between 1 and 4.
mw_q4_affective = Following this, the fourth question will ask you if the content of your thoughts was more positive or negative.\n\nThe response options will be on a 4-point scale ranging from '1: Completely positive' to '4: Completely negative'.\n\nThe answer '1: Completely positive' means you were thinking about something particularly positive (e.g., your kitten or the delicious pizza you ate last night).\n\nSelect 2 or 3 if you feel your answer falls between 1 and 4.\n\nThe answer '4: Completely negative' means you were thinking of something particularly bad, stressful, or anxiety-inducing (e.g., tomorrow's exam that makes you nervous).
mw_on_task_intro = If you report that you were focused on the task (by selecting '3' or '4' on the first question), the next three follow-up questions will be different.\n\nInstead of asking about mind-wandering, they will ask about your experience while you were performing the task.
mw_q2_on_task_instr = The second question will ask whether you were focused more on speed or accuracy during the last block.\n\n'1: Focus entirely on speed' means you were trying to respond as fast as possible.\n\n'4: Focus entirely on accuracy' means you were trying to be as correct as possible, even if it meant being slower.\n\nSelect 2 or 3 if you were balancing both.
mw_q3_on_task_instr = The third question will ask how difficult or easy it was for you to concentrate on the task during the last block.\n\n'1: Extremely difficult to concentrate' means you felt you had to use a lot of mental effort to stay focused.\n\n'4: Extremely easy to concentrate' means your concentration felt automatic and effortless.
mw_q4_on_task_instr = Finally, the fourth question will ask how tiring you found the task during the last block.\n\n'1: Not at all tiring' means you feel you could continue for a long time without feeling mentally fatigued.\n\n'4: Extremely tiring' means the task felt mentally exhausting or draining.

mw_on_task_follow_up = If you responded that you were completely focused on the task in the first question, the subsequent questions will be different:\n\nThe second question will ask if you focused more on speed or accuracy.\nHere you can choose between '1: Focused entirely on Accuracy' and '4: Focused entirely on Speed'.\n\nThe third question will ask how difficult it was for you to concentrate on the task during the previous block.\nHere you can choose between '1: Not difficult at all' and '4: Very difficult'.\n\nThe fourth question will refer to how positive or negative your thoughts were (during brief on-task thoughts).\nHere you can choose between '1: Completely positive' and '4: Completely negative'.\n\nSelect 2 or 3 in each question if you feel your answer falls between the two extremes.
mw_final_note = It is important to note that there are no correct or incorrect answers to these questions and your responses will have no consequence.\n\nPlease answer the questions with complete sincerity.
