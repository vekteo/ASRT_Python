mw_intro = Please try to focus on the task the entire time. However, it's natural for your thoughts to drift away from time to time.\n\nTo investigate this, we will interrupt the task a few times and ask you four questions about whether you were focused on the task or thinking about something else.\n\nUse the 1, 2, 3, and 4 keys to answer these questions!
mw_q1 = First, we will ask you to what extent you were focused on the task during the previous block.\n\nThe response options will be on a 4-point scale ranging from '1: Not focused on the task at all' to '4: Completely focused on the task'.\n\nThe answer '1: Not at all' means that your thoughts were completely elsewhere (e.g., you were thinking about friends, weekend plans, etc.).\n\nThe answer '4: Completely' means that you were totally focused on the task (on where the dog's head appeared and which key you should press as fast as possible).\n\nSelect 2 or 3 if you feel your answer falls between 1 and 4.
mw_q2_off_task = If you respond to the first question that you were somewhat distracted during the task, the second question will ask if, when you were not focused on the task, you were thinking of something specific or not thinking of anything at all.\n\nThe response options will be on a 4-point scale ranging from '1: Thinking of nothing' to '4: Thinking of something specific'.\n\nThe answer '1: Thinking of nothing' means your thoughts drifted, but you don't remember anything specific, as if your mind was completely blank.\n\nThe answer '4: Thinking of something specific' means you were thinking about something in particular (e.g., a book, recent events, the task is very easy, you are hungry, or that sitting during the task is uncomfortable).\n\nSelect 2 or 3 if you feel your answer falls between 1 and 4.
mw_q3_spontaneous = Next, the third question will ask whether your focus (whether on the task or elsewhere) was intentional or spontaneous.\n\nThe response options will be on a 4-point scale ranging from '1: Totally Spontaneous' to '4: Totally Intentional'.\n\nThe answer '1: Totally Spontaneous' means that your attention required no effort to direct. If you were focused on the task, it happened automatically and concentration was not difficult. If your thoughts drifted, it happened despite you wanting to focus on the task.\n\nThe answer '4: Totally Intentional' means that you consciously directed your attention. If you were focused on the task, it was a deliberate decision and you made an effort to concentrate. If your thoughts drifted, it was because you consciously decided to think about something else (like the weekend), which can happen if the task bores you.\n\nSelect 2 or 3 if you feel your answer falls between 1 and 4.
mw_q4_affective = Following this, the fourth question will ask you if the content of your thoughts was more positive or negative.\n\nThe response options will be on a 4-point scale ranging from '1: Totally Negative' to '4: Totally Positive'.\n\nThe answer '1: Totally Negative' means you were thinking of something particularly bad, stressful, or anxiety-inducing (e.g., tomorrow's exam that makes you nervous).\n\nThe answer '4: Totally Positive' means you were thinking about something particularly positive (e.g., your kitten or the delicious pizza you ate last night).\n\nSelect 2 or 3 if you feel your answer falls between 1 and 4.
mw_on_task_follow_up = If you responded that you were completely focused on the task in the first question, the subsequent questions will be different:\n\nThe second question will ask if you focused more on speed or accuracy.\nHere you can choose between '1: Focused entirely on Accuracy' and '4: Focused entirely on Speed'.\n\nThe third question will ask how difficult it was for you to concentrate on the task during the previous block.\nHere you can choose between '1: Not difficult at all' and '4: Very difficult'.\n\nThe fourth question will refer to how positive or negative your thoughts were (during brief on-task thoughts).\nHere you can choose between '1: Totally Negative' and '4: Totally Positive'.\n\nSelect 2 or 3 in each question if you feel your answer falls between the two extremes.
mw_final_note = It is important to note that there are no correct or incorrect answers to these questions and your responses will have no consequence.\n\nPlease answer the questions with complete sincerity.\n\nNext, there will be a 9-question quiz to verify you have correctly understood the instructions for the probe questions.\nIf you are ready, press the SPACE button!
